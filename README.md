This is a basic website which consists of a main index page that contains links 
to some recipes.

Working on this project I learned how to link HTML pages to the index page and 
how to manage the basic elements of a web page such as headers, ordered and 
unordered lists, paragraphs and images.

I have also become more confident with the Git workflow.
