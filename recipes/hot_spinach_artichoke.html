    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy and fragrant. If you don't like artichokes, don't worry â€” you'll never know they're in there! My only question is: Is it okay to eat it with a spoon right out of the dish?</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cream cheese: this satisfying spinach artichoke dip starts with a block of cream cheese</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise: mayonnaise lends creaminess and a welcome tangy flavor</li>
            <li>Cheeses: you'll need grated Parmesan, grated Romano, and shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>Garlic: a clove of minced garlic takes the flavor up a notch</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings: the spinach artichoke dip is seasoned with dried basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper</li>
            <li>Artichoke hearts: drain and chop one can of artichoke hearts</li>
            <li>Spinach: thawed and drained frozen spinach is perfect for this easy recipe</li>
        </ul>
